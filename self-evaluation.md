# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?Fairly confident
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? This one felt good until I got to the second challenge in each.rb
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Need practice/time with all of the methods. Adding it o my calendar to study.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
